# Scenario Runner TODO

## Overview
Design and implement a scenario runner that efficiently manages resource lifecycle by tracking changes and only cleaning up modified resources between runs.

## Requirements

### 1. Scenario Tracking
- [ ] Implement a scenario runner that maintains state of all instantiated scenarios
- [ ] Create a registry to track all resources, domains, and other entities participating in each scenario
- [ ] Establish unique identifiers for scenarios and their associated resources

### 2. Resource Monitoring
- [ ] Implement change detection system that listens to all modifications on tracked resources
- [ ] Create event listeners for:
  - Resource creation
  - Resource modification
  - Resource deletion
  - Domain changes
- [ ] Maintain a change log or state diff for each resource

### 3. Intelligent Cleanup
- [ ] On subsequent scenario runner instantiations:
  - [ ] Identify which resources have changed since last run
  - [ ] Clean up only the modified resources
  - [ ] Preserve unchanged resources to improve performance
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanism for failed cleanups

### 4. Resource Recreation
- [ ] For changed resources that were cleaned up:
  - [ ] Recreate them with updated configuration
  - [ ] Ensure proper initialization order
- [ ] For unchanged resources:
  - [ ] Skip recreation to save time
  - [ ] Verify they are still in valid state

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Minimize scenario initialization time by reusing unchanged resources
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for resource states
- [ ] Add metrics to measure performance improvements

### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] Handle partial cleanup failures gracefully
- [ ] Implement recovery mechanisms for corrupted resource states
- [ ] Provide detailed logging for debugging

## Technical Considerations
- Consider using observer pattern for change detection
- Implement resource versioning or checksums for change detection
- Use dependency graph to determine cleanup order
- Consider thread safety for concurrent scenario execution
